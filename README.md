Here are the steps to get started:

1. make sure your machine has node and git installed (should be no problem if on one of the LL machines)
2. get into your Development folder (type "cd Development")
3. type "git clone https://github.com/ll-dev-team/thesimpleworkflow.git"
4. type `cd thesimpleworkflow`
5. type `atom .`
6. write your code in atom
7. most currently existing functions are available by typing `node thesimpleworkflow` + an argument or two
